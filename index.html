  <p>Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoniâ€™s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, extraordinary 
    merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni

       virtues of the game rely on your abilities and aptitude to execute them in a particular way. Dhoni looks unorthodox at the crease,

    Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for captaincy after Rahul Dravid stepped down as skipper.
